've built a comprehensive weightlifting tracker with an energetic, athletic design featuring warm orange and deep navy tones. The app includes three main sections: a workout logger where you can add exercises with multiple sets (reps and weight), a history view to see all your past workouts, and a progress stats dashboard showing your total workouts, exercises, sets, volume lifted, and most frequent exercises. All data is stored in the browser session, making it perfect for tracking your strength training journey.
